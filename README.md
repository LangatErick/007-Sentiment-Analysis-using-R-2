## Sentiment Analysis using R, of the US presidential debate 2016

### What is Sentiment Analysis?

It is the process of analyzing pieces of text from PDFs, webpages, social media posts, etc. to understand the kinds of emotions being expressed. Millions of texts are being sent every day on tonnes of subjects, and it would be impossible to extract actionable insights from this data simply by reading each text, each Facebook post, and each tweet.

Sentiment Analysis provides an easy way of extracting actionable insights through algorithms developed for programming Languages. For Python check out some of the packages designed for sentiment analysis here. For R users some - packages include;
- tidyr
- tm
- sentiment analysis
- tidytext
- quanteda
For this Analysis, I will use the tidytext package because of its easy implementation alongside the tidyverse package. Find the data used here and as well the R script

From the plot above, *Trump* and *Clinton* more than anyone else have more word frequencies, so let us place a little more interest in them. Let's examine how sentiments vary throughout their speeches.
